# Gotchas

Nix can behave unexpectedly in certain cases.

## Nix does not recognize a new file I added {#git-untracked}

Often you'll see an error like this,

```
error: getting status of '/nix/store/vlks3d7fr5ywc923pvqacx2bkzm1782j-source/foo': No such file or directory
```

This usually means you have not staged this new file/ directory to the Git
index. When using flakes, Nix will not see untracked files/ directories by default. To resolve this, just `git add -N` the untracked file/ directory.

## Nix is broken after macOS upgrade {#macos-upgrade}

Upgrading macOS is known to break Nix. When this happens, just uninstall Nix and then [install](/install) it again.

1. Uninstall Nix
    - Run `/nix/nix-installer uninstall`
    - If that path above does not exist, [follow these instructions](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415830650265-Uninstall-nix-on-MacOS) to manually unintall Nix.
