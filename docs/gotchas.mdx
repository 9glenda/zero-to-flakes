# Gotchas

Nix can behave unexpectedly in certain cases.

## Nix does not recognize a new file I added

Often you'll see an error like this,

```
error: getting status of '/nix/store/vlks3d7fr5ywc923pvqacx2bkzm1782j-source/foo': No such file or directory
```

This usually mean you have not staged this new file or directory to the Git
index. When using flakes, Nix will not see untracked files by default. See
https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/8389
